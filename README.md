# Activity 27: CSS GRID

## CSS Grid
Is a powerful layout system in CSS that allows you to create complex and responsive web layouts with ease. It provides a grid-based approach to layout design, enabling developers to divide a webpage into rows and columns. Here's a detailed overview of CSS Grid:

## Key Features of CSS Grid

### Grid Container and Items:

* A grid layout starts by defining a container with display: grid or display: inline-grid.
The direct children of this container become grid items.

* Defining Rows and Columns:
You can define the structure of the grid using properties like grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, allowing you to specify the size of each row and column.

* Grid Gaps:
The gap, row-gap, and column-gap properties allow you to control the space between grid items.

* Placement of Grid Items:
You can position grid items using grid-column and grid-row properties, specifying where each item should start and end.

* Responsive Design:
CSS Grid is inherently responsive. You can change the layout based on screen size using media queries.

* Auto-Placement:
CSS Grid can automatically place grid items based on the available space, making it easier to manage layouts without specifying exact positions for every item.

### Advantages of CSS Grid
* Flexible Layouts: Easily create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
* Simplicity: Reduce the complexity of layout creation compared to older methods like floats or positioning.
* Control: Provides precise control over item placement and sizing.
